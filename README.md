# opengit
opengit or libregit should suplement github way of finding the git repositoriy. 

## Idea and Motivation
There are plenty of github alternative to store open and libre software. Why are people who choose alternative penalize in searchablity of their project. Why don't we have one place to look for Open and libre software across all the alternatives, including github. 

So I had idea of creating community owned, curated searchable website where anybody can search across the git repos to find their open software. 

1. Create database of open repos
2. Create search for these repos
3. Create easy way to add repos
4. Be able to flag bad repos.
5. Comunity mantained database of repositories.
6. Create curation dashboards with 
 - Most used
 - Hot repos
 - Libre repos
 - MIT repos
 - Newly added
 - Follow your own repos ??? 


Note: libre(free) software is open so they are not mutually exclusive.
